Sure, I can help create such a function using Python as an example due to its simplicity and wide applicability.

Here is what we're going to do:

1. Define a dictionary where keys represent order statuses (e.g., 'pending', 'shipped') and values represent corresponding updated statuses (e.g., 'processing', 'delivered'). The function will use this dictionary to check if the status has changed and update the records accordingly.
2. Write a function that takes in two arguments: a list of order dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an order with keys 'order_id' and 'status'. The second argument is the updated status based on the corresponding key-value pair in the dictionary mentioned in step 1.
3. Inside this function, we will iterate over each order dictionary in the input list. For each dictionary, we will check if the current order status matches the given updated status for the corresponding order status. If there is a match, we will update the 'status' key-value pair in the order dictionary with the new updated status.
4. Finally, we will return the modified list of order dictionaries with their statuses updated accordingly.

Let's write this function and test it with some sample data.
```python
def detect_and_update_order_status(orders: list[dict], updated_status: str) -> list[dict]:
    # Define a dictionary to map order statuses to their updated counterparts
    status_updates_map = {
        'pending': 'processing',
        'shipped': 'delivered'
    }

    # Iterate over each order in the input list
    for order in orders:
        current_order_status = order['status']

        # Check if the current order status matches the given updated status for the corresponding order status
        if current_order_status in status_updates_map.keys() and status_updates_map[current_order_status] == updated_status:
            # If there is a match, update the 'status' key-value pair in the order dictionary with the new updated status
            order['status'] = updated_status

    return orders

# Sample data for testing
orders = [
    {'order_id': 1, 'status': 'pending'},
    {'order_id': 2, 'status': 'shipped'},
    {'order_id': 3, 'status': 'delivered'}
]
updated_status = 'processing'

# Call the function and print the result
result = detect_and_update_order_status(orders, updated_status))
print(result)
```
