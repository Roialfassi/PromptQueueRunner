Here is an example of how you might write this function in Python using object-oriented programming:

```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self, order_id, total):
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.total = total
        self.pages = None

    def set_pages(self, pages):
        self.pages = pages

    def navigate_to_page(self, page_number):
        if self.pages is not None and 0 < page_number <= len(self.pages):
            print("Navigating to page:", page_number)
            return True
        else:
            print("Invalid page number:", page_number)
            return False

    def display_order_info(self):
        if self.pages is not None:
            for i in range(len(self.pages))):
                print("Page", i+1, ":")
                for item in self.pages[i]:
                    print("Order ID:", item['order_id']),
                    print("Total:", item['total'])
```

This is a basic implementation of pagination navigation for an order. You can create an instance of the `Order` class, set its pages using the `set_pages()` method and then navigate to different pages using the `navigate_to_page()` method.

Please note that this is a very basic example and does not take into account many factors such as error handling, edge case handling etc. It's always a good idea to add these features when writing production-level code.
