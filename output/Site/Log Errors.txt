Here's a simple Python solution using the built-in `logging` library:

```python
import logging

def scrape_with_error_handling(url):
    try:
        # Your web scraping code here
        page = requests.get(url)
        data = page.json()
        return data

    except Exception as e:
        logging.exception("An error occurred during the scraping process.")
```

In this solution, we define a function called `scrape_with_error_handling`. This function takes a single argument, `url`, which is the URL to be scraped.

Inside the function, we use a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the scraping process.

If an exception is caught, we log it using the `logging` library. We pass in a string message indicating that an error occurred during the scraping process.

After the try-except block, the function will either return the scraped data or log the error and terminate the function.
