Sure! Here's an implementation of a function that filters orders based on specific criteria:

```python
def filter_orders(orders, criteria):
    filtered_orders = []

    # Iterate through each order
    for order in orders:
        # Check if the order meets the specified criteria
        if check_criteria(order, criteria)):
            filtered_orders.append(order)

    return filtered_orders
```

This function takes two parameters: `orders`, which is a list of dictionaries representing different orders, and `criteria`, which is a dictionary specifying the specific criteria to filter on.

The function iterates through each order in the `orders` list. For each order, it calls the `check_criteria()` function, passing the current order and the specified criteria.

The `check_criteria()` function checks if the order meets the specified criteria by comparing the values of the respective keys in the order dictionary and the criteria dictionary. If all the criteria are met for a particular order, it is added to the filtered orders list.

Finally, the function returns the filtered orders list.

You can use this `filter_orders()` function to filter orders based on specific criteria by passing the appropriate arguments to the function.
