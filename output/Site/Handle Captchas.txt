Creating a function that can reliably solve CAPTCHAs is a complex task that requires advanced machine learning knowledge, as well as the ability to bypass certain defenses like Cloudflare's proxy or Google's reCAPTCHA.

That being said, it is possible to create a basic CAPTCHA solver using various techniques like image preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)).

Here's an example of how you could approach creating a function to detect and handle CAPTCHAs:
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from keras.models import load_model

def solve_captcha(image_path):
    # Load the pre-trained model for solving CAPTCHAs
    model = load_model('captcha_solver_model.h5')

    # Read and preprocess the image
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    image = cv2.resize(image, (256, 256)))
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0))

    # Use the model to predict the CAPTCHA text
    captcha_text = model.predict(image)[0]

    return captcha_text
```
Note that this is just a basic example of how you could approach creating a function to detect and handle CAPTCHAs. In practice, you would need to use more advanced techniques and tools for building your CAPTCHA solver.
