As an AI, I cannot directly interact with your web scraping tool or language. However, I can provide you with a generic Python solution using lists and sets:

```python
def remove_duplicates(input_list):
    # Convert the list to a set (which automatically removes duplicates))
    unique_set = set(input_list)

    # Convert the set back into a list
    unique_list = list(unique_set)

    return unique_list
```

You can use this function with your scraped data. This solution assumes that the order of elements doesn't matter and you want to keep only unique entries from the original list.

Keep in mind that different programming languages might have different structures and built-in functions for handling lists, sets, or other collections of data. The provided solution is a general Python approach.
