To solve this problem, we would typically use a language that supports interacting with databases such as SQL or even more popular languages like Python or Java.

However, as an AI text-based model, I don't have the ability to interact directly with databases, execute code in live environments, or simulate real-world conditions.

Nevertheless, here's a pseudo-code/function representation of what you're asking for:

```python
def update_database(orders):
  # Iterate over all orders
  for order in orders:
    # Check if there are any changes in the existing order record
    if hasChangesInOrderRecord(order)):
      # If there are changes, update the corresponding records in the database
      updateDatabaseRecords(order)
```

This pseudo-code function represents a potential structure for solving your problem. However, implementing this solution would require access to the specific database system being used, as well as knowledge of the exact structure and requirements of the order data and database records.
