Sure, here's an example of how you might implement a function to handle logging in to websites that require authentication to access order information:
```python
import requests
from getpass import getpass

def login_to_website(url):
    """
    Logs in to a website that requires
    authentication to access order information.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL of the website to log in to.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the authentication token for accessing order information.
    """

    # Set up the login data
    username = input("Enter your username: ")
    password = getpass("Enter your password: ")
    login_data = {
        "username": username,
        "password": password
    }

    # Send a POST request to the website's authentication endpoint
    auth_response = requests.post(url + "/login"), json=login_data)

    # Check if the login was successful
    if auth_response.status_code == 200:
        # If the login was successful, extract the authentication token from the response
        auth_token = auth_response.json().get("authentication_token")
        return {"authentication_token": auth_token}
    else:
        # If the login was not successful, raise an exception
        raise Exception(f"Failed to log in to {url}. Response status code: {auth_response.status_code}")
```python
{
  "code": "import requests\nfrom getpass import getpass\n\ndef login_to_website(url):\n    \"\"\"\n    Logs in to a website that requires\n    authentication to access order information.\n\n    Args:\n        url (str): The URL of the website to log in to.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the authentication token for accessing order information.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Set up the login data\n    username = input(\"Enter your username: \"))\n    password = getpass(\"Enter your password: \"))\n    login_data = {\n        \"username\": username,\n        \"password\": password\n    }}\n\n    # Send a POST request to the website's authentication endpoint\n    auth_response = requests.post(url + \"/login\")), json=login_data)\n\n    # Check if the login was successful\n    if auth_response.status_code == 200:\n        # If the login was successful, extract the authentication token from the response\n        auth_token = auth_response.json().get(\"authentication_token\"))\n        return {\n            \"authentication_token\": auth_token\n        }}\n    else:\n        # If the login was not successful, raise an exception\n        raise Exception(f\"Failed to log in to {url}. Response status code: {auth_response.status_code}\")"
}
```
