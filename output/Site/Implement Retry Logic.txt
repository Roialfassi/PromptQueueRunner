Here is an example of how such a function could be implemented in Python using the tenacity library for retrying on transient errors:

```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3),
                          wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))
def scrape_data(url):
    # Your scraping code here
    pass
```

This function will retry up to 3 times for handling transient errors during the scraping process. 

The exact implementation might vary depending on your specific requirements and constraints such as maximum request per minute/hour, etc.
