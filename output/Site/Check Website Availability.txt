As an AI language model, I can't directly execute code but I can certainly provide you with a Python implementation of a function that checks if a website is up and accessible before attempting to scrape:

```python
import requests
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def is_website_up(url):
    """Check if the given website URL is up and reachable.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL of the website to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the website is up and reachable, False otherwise.
    """
    # Prepare the URL by joining it with itself (self) if necessary
    url = urljoin(url, url)

    try:
        # Send a request to the website's URL
        response = requests.get(url)

        # Check if the response status code is within the range of successful HTTP status codes (200-299))
        if 200 <= response.status_code < 300:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while checking if {url} is up and reachable: {e}")
        return False
```

This function checks if the website is accessible by sending a request to its URL. If the response status code indicates that the request was successful (200-299)), then the website is considered up and accessible, and the function returns True. Otherwise, the function catches any exception that occurs during the execution of the code, prints an error message indicating what went wrong, and finally returns False.

Note that this implementation uses the `requests` library to send HTTP requests, so you'll need to install it first if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:
```
pip install requests
```
