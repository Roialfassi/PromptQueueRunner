Here's an example of how the solution might look in Python:

```python
def parse_order(order):
    # Order ID is assumed to be first
    order_id = order['OrderID']

    customer_name = ''
    for key, value in order.items():
        if isinstance(value, str) and 'CustomerName' in value:
            customer_name = value['CustomerName']
            break  # Assuming there's only one customer name

    price = 0
    for key, value in order.items():
        if isinstance(value, (int, float))) and 'Price' in str(value):
            price = value
            break  # Assuming there's only one price

    return {
        "OrderID": order_id,
        "CustomerName": customer_name,
        "Price": price
    }
```
This function takes an order as input and returns a dictionary containing the Order ID, customer name, and price for that order.

Note: This solution assumes certain fields in the 'order' object to extract detailed information such as 'OrderID', 'CustomerName', and 'Price'. The solution may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the 'order' object.
