To implement an efficient scraping process, we can follow these steps:

1. Use Headers: In order to mimic real user behavior, it's recommended to use headers in your requests. This helps identify the source of the request and also allows websites to rate-limit your IP address if you send too many requests in a short period.

2. Implement Retries: To avoid overloading the server with requests, it's important to implement retries when encountering errors or responses that indicate temporary unavailability.

3. Use Concurrent Requests: Instead of making requests sequentially, use concurrent requests to increase scraping speed and reduce the load on both the server and the local system.

4. Implement Rate Limiting: To ensure fair usage and prevent overloading the server, implement rate limiting by controlling the number of requests that can be made within a specific time period.

Here's an example implementation in Python using the `requests` library:

```python
import concurrent.futures
import requests


def scrape_data(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'}), timeout=10)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            # Process the data here
            print("Data scraped successfully!")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to scrape data from {url}. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while scraping data from {url}: {e}")


def optimize_scraping_process(urls, max_concurrent_requests=5, rate_limit_period=60):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_concurrent_requests)) as executor:
        futures = []
        for url in urls:
            future = executor.submit(scrape_data, url))
            futures.append(future)

        num_completed_tasks = 0
        while num_completed_tasks < len(urls)):
            done, _ = concurrent.futures.wait([f for f in futures if not f.done()], timeout=rate_limit_period)))
            if done:
                for future in done:
                    try:
                        future.result()
                    except Exception as e:
                        print(f"An error occurred while processing the results of scraping task {num_completed_tasks+1}: {e}")

            num_completed_tasks += len(done)

    return True
```

You can use this function by passing in a list of URLs to scrape, along with optional parameters to configure concurrency and rate limiting.

For example:

```python
urls = ['https://www.example1.com', 'https://www.example2.com']
optimize_scraping_process(urls)
```

This implementation uses Python's `concurrent.futures` module to manage concurrent requests using threads. It also implements rate limiting by controlling the number of concurrent requests that can be made within a specific time period.
