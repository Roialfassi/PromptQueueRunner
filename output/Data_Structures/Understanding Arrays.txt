Arrays are powerful data structure that allows us to store a collection of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. 

Memory Allocation: When we declare an array in our code, the computerâ€™s operating system allocates a block of memory large enough to hold all of the array's elements. This process is known as dynamic memory allocation or garbage collection.

Role and Building Blocks for Other Data Structures: Arrays serve as the building blocks for other data structures such as linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, etc. They provide a flexible way to organize and manipulate data.

For instance, an array can be used as a basis for a stack or a queue by defining its behavior using pointers or references that point to the beginning or end of the array respectively. 

On the other hand, arrays can also serve as nodes in a linked list, where each node contains some data and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This way, arrays provide a flexible way to implement various types of data structures efficiently.
