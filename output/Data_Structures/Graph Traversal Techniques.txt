Graph Traversal Algorithms are widely used in computer science for tasks such as finding paths, detecting cycles, or even just exploring the structure of a graph. 

1. Breadth-First Search (BFS): BFS starts at the root node and explores the neighbor nodes first before moving to the next level neighbors. This ensures that the shortest path will be found first by these algorithms. 

   Applications: Used in network routing, file systems for computers and operating systems used on personal computers and smartphones.
  
2. Depth-First Search (DFS): DFS starts at a root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This ensures that the longest path will be found first by these algorithms.

   Applications: Used in compiler construction, detecting cycles in graphs or networks, optimizing data storage and retrieval systems such as databases.
  
To sum up, BFS is used for finding the shortest path between nodes (or vertices) in a graph whereas DFS is used for exploring all possible paths leading to a solution. The choice of which traversal algorithm to use generally depends on the specific problem being solved and the characteristics of the graph or network being analyzed.
