Red-Black Trees are advanced data structures that come under the category of self-balancing binary search tree (BST). The key idea behind Red-Black Trees is to balance the tree using color flipping and rotations.

1. **Properties**:
   - Every node in a red-black tree has two children, denoted as `left` and `right`.
   - The root of the tree is always black.
   - All leaves (NIL) are considered black since they don't have any children.
   - If a node is red then both its children should be black.
   - Every simple path from a given node to a leaf contains the same number of black nodes as the length of the path. This property holds true for every insertion, deletion, and rotation operation in the tree.

2. **Insertion**:
   - Start with inserting a new node using the standard BST insertion process.
   - After insertion, check if the newly inserted node is red or black.
   - If the parent of the newly inserted node is black, then flip the color of both the parent and the grandparent (if it exists). Repeat this step until you reach a leaf node. The root of the tree becomes black after performing these steps during insertion.

3. **Deletion**:
   - Similar to insertion, perform the standard BST deletion process for deleting a given node in the red-black tree.
   - After the deletion operation, check if the parent of the deleted node is red or black.
   - If the parent of the deleted node is black, then flip the color of both the parent and the grandparent (if it exists)). Repeat this step until you reach a leaf node. The root of the tree becomes black after performing these steps during deletion.

4. **Rotation**:
   - Red-Black Trees use rotations to maintain their balance property. There are three types of rotations: left rotation, right rotation, and grandparent-grandchild swap.
   - Left rotation is performed by first making the right child of the node to be rotated as the new root of the subtree. Then, make the parent of the original root as the new root of the subtree. Finally, update the color of the nodes involved in this rotation operation (if they exist)).

5. **Maintaining Balance**:
   - As mentioned earlier, Red-Black Trees are self-balancing binary search trees.
   - The balance property of a red-black tree ensures that it remains approximately balanced.
   - During insertion and deletion operations, the balance properties of the affected subtrees are maintained by performing rotations and color flipping as required.

It's important to note that maintaining the balance property of Red-Black Trees requires careful consideration of the affected subtrees during both insertion and deletion operations. By adhering to the rules for insertion and deletion, along with maintaining the balance property using rotations and color flipping, a robust red-black tree implementation can be achieved.
