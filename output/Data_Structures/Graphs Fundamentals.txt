Graphs are mathematical models used in fields such as computer science, biology, physics, etc., to represent relationships between objects or events. 

Terminology: 
- Vertices: The points that form the vertices of a graph. In a simple graph model, these could be anything (e.g., people, cities, proteins, etc.).
- Edges: The connections between vertices in a graph. An edge represents a relationship or connection between two objects or events. 

Types of Graphs: 
1. Directed Graphs: In a directed graph, the edges have a "direction" which implies that one vertex can be reached from another vertex only through an outgoing directed edge.
2. Undirected Graphs: In an undirected graph, the edges have no direction, implying that one vertex can be connected to another vertex by means of any edge connecting these two vertices. 

Representations: 
1. Adjacency Matrix Representation: An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. Each cell in the matrix represents an edge between two vertices if the corresponding cell contains a '1' and '0' otherwise.
2. Adjacency List Representation: An adjacency list, also called adjacent matrix representation for undirected graphs, is a way of representing a finite graph as a collection of unordered lists where each list consists of the neighbors of a vertex. 

In summary, graphs can be represented using either an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list. The choice between these two representations depends on the specific requirements of the problem being solved.
